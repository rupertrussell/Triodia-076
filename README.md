This program is designed to help measure the area of spinefix hummocks 
A one meter marker is placed on the ground and a drone takes photographs of the site
marking the coners of the 1 meter square allows the program to be calabrated to the photograph
which the allows you to draw a perimeter around a hummock and then fill it with yellow pxels
which are then counted to provide the area of each hummock
